# SecurePassGen
Randomly generates passwords with customizable length. Provides an option to hide or display passwords. Easily copy generated passwords to the clipboard. Simple and clean UI for smooth user experience. I built this project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's a great example of how I'm applying my web development skills to create practical tools.
